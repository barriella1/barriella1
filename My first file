<p>Today is Thursday October 28 2021. About two weeks ago i gave up my job due to feeling extreemly overwhelmed and never appriciated.
    Right now i'm out of a job and very confused what actions to take next. In the one hand I'm struggling with severe depression which is minimizing my ability to have a job but in the other hand i need an income to live.
    <br>
    <br>
    I apllied for several programs from the government but right now haven't heard back from any of them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Last night i wasn't able to sleep much. I fall asleep later then 2:00 AM and woke up around 6:00AM.

<h2><marquee>Hey I'm back</marquee></h2>
<p>So I went to a local bike shop and they repaired my bike. I must say it felt pretty good being able to ride back home.</p>
